# Helicopter Racing League

- Global sports league (i.e. lots of regional focus)
- World championships **and** regional leagues
- Offers paid streaming service with predictions (uptime is therefore important)

## Concerns

- Migrate to new platform
- Use AI & ML
- New regions
- Stream + record closer to users to keep latency down

## Existing

- Already in a cloud
- Object storage
- VM video encode/transcode at the racetracks
- Running predictions using TensorFlow on other VM'sin the cloud

## Business requirements

- Models to partners
- Increase telemetry
- Measure fan engagement (AI and ML models)
- Increase concurrent viewers
- Ensure compliance
- Merchandise (some e-commerce app or connection to one)

## Technical requirements

- Prediction throughput
- Reduce latency
- Transcoding performance **(vertically scale up their VM's on the processing side - i.e. "add more compute to one machine")**
- Realtime analysis (streaming data and data pipeline)
- Batch

## Summary

- Predictions with AI and ML
- Extending reach and market
- Lots of data in near-real time
